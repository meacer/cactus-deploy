# Overrides docker/init-sunlight.sh from the cactus repo ($CACTUS_DIR).
# docker-deploy.sh copies the cactus repo's docker/ directory to the VM and
# then drops this file on top of it.
#
# Delta from upstream (mcpherrinm/cactus @ main): also create
# /var/lib/sunlight/keepalive-public. sunlight.yaml.tmpl declares that
# directory as the keepalive log's `localdirectory`, but upstream's copy of
# this script never creates it, so skylight exits at startup. Remove this file
# once that fix lands upstream.
#
# Init step 2 of 3 (runs in the sunlight image).
#
# Derives Sunlight's witness/mirror keys from a single seed, builds the
# log list naming cactus's issuance log, and pre-creates the checkpoint
# lock database. Sunlight deliberately refuses to create that database
# itself, as a guard against pointing a log at the wrong backend, so it
# has to exist before first start.
#
# Idempotent, for the same reason as init-cactus.sh.
